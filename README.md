Overview of the project:
This web app allows users to generate AQI predictions based on a number of factors, including City name, PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene concentration levels.
The app is powered by a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of historical AQI data. The model takes into account all of the input factors to generate a prediction that is as accurate as possible.

Purpose:
•	Planning outdoor activities
•	Making informed decisions about air quality
•	Tracking trends in air quality over time

Features and functionalities:
•	AQI Prediction: The core functionality of the app is to generate AQI predictions based on user-provided inputs, including city name and pollutant concentration levels.
•	Input Validation: To ensure data accuracy, the app validates user inputs, such as city names and pollutant values, to prevent errors or invalid data from being processed.
•	Historical Data Analysis: The app analyzes historical AQI data to provide insights into air quality trends over time for the selected location. This can help users understand seasonal variations and long-term changes.
•	AQI Categories and Health Impacts: The app categorizes the AQI prediction into different levels (e.g., Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe) and provides information on the associated health impacts, helping users assess the severity of air quality.
•	Location Selection: Users can input the name of a specific city or location to obtain AQI predictions for that area, allowing for personalized and location-specific results.
•	Educational Resources: The app provides information about AQI, air pollutants, and health precautions to educate users about the significance of air quality.
•	Responsive Design: The app's responsive design ensures that it is accessible and functional on various devices and screen sizes.

How to Use the App?
•	Enter the name of the city for which you want to generate a prediction.
•	Enter the desired values for all of the input factors.
•	Click the "Calculate" button.
•	The app will generate a prediction of the AQI for the given location and conditions.
