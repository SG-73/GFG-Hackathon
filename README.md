# GFG Hackathon – Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Web Application

### Overview
This interactive web application predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) of different cities based on pollutant concentration levels such as PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO₂, NOx, NH₃, CO, SO₂, O₃, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene.

Powered by a machine learning model trained on historical AQI data, the app delivers accurate predictions and offers insights into air quality conditions across regions.

### Purpose
- To assist users in planning outdoor activities safely.  
- To help individuals and organizations make informed decisions about air quality.  
- To enable tracking of air quality trends and variations over time.

### Features and Functionalities
1. **AQI Prediction:** Generates AQI predictions based on user-provided inputs, including city name and pollutant concentration levels.  
2. **Input Validation:** Validates user inputs to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.  
3. **Historical Data Analysis:** Analyzes historical AQI data to identify trends, seasonal variations, and long-term air quality patterns.  
4. **AQI Categories and Health Impacts:** Classifies AQI into standard categories — *Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor,* and *Severe* — with insights on corresponding health impacts.  
5. **Location Selection:** Allows users to select or enter a city name to generate location-specific AQI predictions.  
6. **Educational Insights:** Provides essential information about AQI components, pollutants, and recommended health precautions.  
7. **Responsive Interface:** The app features a clean, responsive design accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### How to Use the App
1. Enter the name of the city for which you want to generate an AQI prediction.  
2. Provide the pollutant concentration values as inputs.  
3. Click the **"Calculate"** button to generate the result.  
4. The app will display the AQI value along with its corresponding category and health impact.

### Prerequisites to Run
- **Code (GFG_AQI.ipynb):** No dependencies required.  
- **Code (AQI_Prediction.py):** Requires Streamlit.  
- **Web App:** No setup required for hosted deployment.
